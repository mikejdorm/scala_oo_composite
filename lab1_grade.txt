Excellent use of Scala's trait system. Really went above and beyond here. You
could probably use runtime function polymorphism (in combination with the way
you're using traits) to avoid the pattern-matching in the PricingVisitor...but
the way you do it isn't too bad. Using polymorphism there would prevent you from
having to add cases when you add new Leaves or non-top-level composites, though,
which would certainly be convenient.
